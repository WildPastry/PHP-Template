# PHP Website

This site is created using PHP and Bootstrap.
It uses templating to be able to use only one file for the header and footer but the main content stays the same.

## Task

Create a new form which includes a range of input fields, but must have at least 1 file upload and 1 text area.
1. Add validation to the entire form and make sure you cant submit it until all inputs are valid.
2. Save the image into the image folder.

**Extra Tasks**
1. Create a function which checks to see if the user has already submitted the form. There are many ways which you can create this ability.
2. Include another file input which isn't an image but still needs to validate the file type.

**Extra Extra Tasks**
1. When the form is submitted, create a file which contains the information which you had filled out in the form. You can use php functions to create, and append text onto a file. Look at the link bellow for how you can manipulate .txt files
